# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information regarding employees that are close to retirement. This is important to provide an overview of staffing needs and hiring plans. This is required to prevent employee shortage which can cause remaining employees to become overwhelmed with short-staffed situations. The variables used are hired date vs. birthdate to retrieve the data showing who is going to retire soon according to age. 

### Results
1. At first glance, with our first query, it looked like we had a whole lot of employees retiring. 133,776 to be exact. The problem was duplicates. 
Here we can see one employee (Sumant, Peac) listed on three rows, so this number is not accurate.
